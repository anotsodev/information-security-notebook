# Penetration Testing

This subject matter contains some of the basic and intermediate topics and techniques in penetration testing. It also includes the writeups in Vulnerable VMs that I successfully rooted \(you can read these writeups if you are stuck but of course it is more fun if you will solve and root these boxes on your own\).
