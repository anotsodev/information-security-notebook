# The OSI and TCP/IP Model

## OSI Model

The Open Systems Interconnection or OSI is a model that illustrates the different layers in networking.

The following layers are:

1. Physical Layer
2. Data Link Layer
3. Network Layer
4. Transport Layer
5. Session Layer
6. Presentation Layer
7. Application Layer

## **Definitions and Examples**

### Physical Layer

In general, physical layer are the devices that can be actually held and measure to transmit signals or bits \(zeroes and ones\) to the network. Physical layer is responsible for the conversion of data to signals.

**Examples:**

* Cables
* Network Interface Card \(NIC\)
* Hubs
* etc.

### Data Link Layer

Data link layer is responsible for packaging the bits/data into frames. Data link layer transfers data from one point to another. It uses the Address Resolution Protocol to map the IP address of the devices on their mac addresses.

### Network Layer

Network layer is responsible for routing the transmission of data on the network.

### Transport Layer

Transport layer is responsible for ensuring that the data are packaged and it has the necessary headers that contains information on where the data will be transmitted.

### Session Layer

Session layer is responsible for establishing sessions for the devices to communicate with each other.

### Presentation Layer

Presentation layer is responsible for the encryption and decryption of the data transmitted on the network.

### Application Layer

Application layer is responsible for viewing the information of the data.

## TCP/IP Model
