# The OSI and TCP/IP Model

The Open Systems Interconnection or OSI is a model that illustrates the different layers in networking.

The following layers are:

1. Physical Layer
2. Data Link Layer
3. Network Layer
4. Transport Layer
5. Session Layer
6. Presentation Layer
7. Application Layer

## **Definitions and Examples**

### Physical Layer

In general, physical layer are the devices that can be actually held and measure to transmit signals or bits \(zeroes and ones\) to the network. Physical layer is responsible for the conversion of data to signals.

**Examples:**

* Cables
* Network Interface Card \(NIC\)
* Hubs
* etc.

### Data Link Layer

Data link layer is responsible for packaging the bits/data into frames.
